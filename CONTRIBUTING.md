## Coding Standards

### JavaScript

- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use semicolons
- Maximum line length: 120 characters

```javascript
/**
 * Processes audio file for transcription
 * @param {File} audioFile - The audio file to process
 * @param {Object} options - Processing options
 * @returns {Promise<string>} Transcribed text
 */
const processAudioFile = async (audioFile, options = {}) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### CSS

- Follow Stylelint configuration
- Use meaningful class names
- Prefer CSS custom properties for theming
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Group related properties together

```css
.audio-controls {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
  
  padding: 1rem;
  background-color: var(--bg-primary);
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Use meaningful IDs and classes
- Include proper meta tags

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage

```javascript
describe('AudioManager', () => {
  test('should start recording when startRecording is called', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const audioManager = new AudioManager();
    
    // Act
    await audioManager.startRecording();
    
    // Assert
    expect(audioManager.isRecording).toBe(true);
  });
});
